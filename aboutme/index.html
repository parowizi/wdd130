    <h2>Paragon Ikponmwonba</h2>
<p>Hello everyone my name is Paragon, close family members call me Paro sometimes, especially my dad. I’m from Nigeria. I’m single.</p>
<p>I graduated from the University of Benin, Nigeria in 2014. I studied Civil Engineering. Now I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems at the City University of New York. As well as an online degree in Applied Technology BS at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>I love to listen to music as well as sing, watch a soccer match, cook, organize, watch movies, and surf the internet. </p>
<p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 19 years. My favorite quote is from Russell M. Nelson which says and I quote “He will lead and guide your personal life if you will make time for Him in your life each and every day.” End quote.</p>
<p>I look forward to a successful study in this online class and hopefully make new friends.</p>
